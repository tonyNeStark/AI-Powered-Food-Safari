# TASK OVERVIEW
Consider yourself as an expert on Natural Language Processing related issues. 

# INPUT
- PROPOSALS_FILE1: {proposals_file1}
- PROPOSALS_FILE2: {proposals_file2}
- PROPOSALS_FILE2: {proposals_file3}
- INPUT FORMAT file: 
    ASPECT: "<aspect-name1>" Category: [explicit or implicit]

# DESIRED OUTPUT FORMAT
The final consolidated aspects should strictly follow this format:

1. ASPECT: "<aspect-name1>" Category: [implicit or explicit]
2. ASPECT: "<aspect-name2>" Category: [implicit or explicit]
so on ....

# INSTRUCTIONS
1. Analyze all proposed aspects from different LLMs in PROPOSALS_FILE1, PROPOSALS_FILE2, PROPOSALS_FILE3.
2. Identify common aspects across models and merge them into a unified list.
3. Remove duplicates: Retain only one representative term for aspects with similar meanings.
4. Refine vague aspects: Ensure that each aspect is clear, precise, and useful for restaurant analysis.
5. Eliminate irrelevant or overly specific aspects that do not generalize well across restaurants.
6. Classify aspects as explicit or implicit based on their nature.
7. Do not include explanations or justificationsâ€”return only the final list in the DESIRED OUTPUT FORMAT.
